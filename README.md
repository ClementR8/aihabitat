# aihabitat
Repository containing setup codes and basic codes to have basic material and start using AiHabitat

The first step to use the simulator is to do the whole setup by following the README from the habitat_sim github repository (link : https://github.com/facebookresearch/habitat-sim/blob/085fad8ee07ac257386457f0f6b0dec4bed7004d/README.md) or the Habitat_Setup file that I created in this repository.

Once you will be ready you can clone this repository and try some codes. 
The codes you will want to try are in the basic_codes folder, the other folders either contain results of simulation, or codes that I developped to do a specific task and that can be reused in your own programs.

Good luck !
